# Chapter 1: Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications

The foundation of all data systems, whether running on a single machine or distributed across a cluster of machines is:

* **Reliability**: tolerating hardware and software faults, human error
* **Scalability**: Measuring load and performance, latency, percentiles and thoughput
* **Maintainability**: Operability, simplicity, and evolvability
