# Preface

## Introduction

In server-side and backend systems, new buzzwords are emerging relating to storing and processing data, such as _NoSQL, big data, web-scale, sharding, eventual consistency, ACID, CAP theorem, cloud services, MapReduce, & real-time._ 

In this book, we will find useful ways of **thinking about data systems**  - not just **how they work**, but also **why they work that way**, and what questions we need to ask.

## Data-Intensive vs. Compute-Intensive Applications
An application is **data-intensive** if data is its primary challenge - the quality of data, the complexity of data, or the speed at which it is changing - as opposed to **compute-intensive**, where CPU cycles are the bottleneck.

## Goal of this book
After reading this book, you will be in a great position to decide which kind of technology is appropriate for which purpose, and understand how tools can be combined to form the foundation of a good application architecture.
